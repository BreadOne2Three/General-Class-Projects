# General Class Projects
 Some miscellaneous class projects that aren't exactly 'game-changing' but I feel did some neat things


# CSCN 345 Python Game-Paparazzi - A Game Made for my 'Intro to Linux' class
It is a heavily modified version of the [Hit the Chimp Game Tutorial](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/ChimpLineByLine.html). I followed the tutorial here, and modified my code to;
- made it 2-player
	- This meant adding player 'WASD' input and altered the speed, directions etc. of the second player (also added boundaries so they couldn't just go outside of bounds and never be hit)
- have a win state
- added some sound effects
- Also added some notes/documentation to the main py file, making it more apparent what each line did

# General Linux scripts - Some more scripts I made for my 345 class. 
## Password Generator
Especially proud of the password generator bash script, as it took a lot of trial and error to find working solutions, finding a website whose script contained the word I was needing, etc. 
## TheCronJob.txt
an auto update script for linux using cron, and creates a log in case something goes wrong trying to update
updates every Tuesday at 1:00 AM
## contactFinder2
Another bash script that will take a series of inputs, and output them to a txt file in a format that can be read back in with ':' used as variable separators
I'm proud of how the output looks and all, but the code itself feels a little too jumbled *but* it did do everything that the professor requested for the project
